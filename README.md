# VisãoClara - Brazilian Glasses Store

![VisãoClara Logo](logo.png)

## Overview

VisãoClara is a portfolio project that simulates a Brazilian glasses store website built using VueJS 2. This project showcases the implementation of Vue Router and Vuex, two essential VueJS features. The project is based on a Figma design, and it aims to demonstrate the skills and capabilities of the developer.

Please note that VisãoClara is not a real project or a functioning online store. It serves as a demonstration of front-end development using VueJS 2, router navigation, state management with Vuex, and adhering to a design provided in a Figma file.
